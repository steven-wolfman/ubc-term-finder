# Development Process/Tutorial

One of the main developers (Steve) is UBC CPSC faculty and doing this in part just to brush up on skills and be a teacher. So, this will be a living rundown of the creation process.

## Early Stages

### Setup

To publish an npm package, we're starting from [BetterStack's best practices article](https://betterstack.dev/blog/npm-package-best-practices/).

To get set up, Steve created a public [Github](https://github.com/) repo with an MIT license and the Node .gitignore file. For the name, the BetterStack article and [npm's guidelines for package names](https://docs.npmjs.com/package-name-guidelines) suggested short, clear, lowercase naming, and we wanted the Github repo and npm package names to match. `ubc-term-finder` seemed short and clear; so, that's the name of the [repo](https://github.com/steven-wolfman/ubc-term-finder).

Steve then used the [`Manage access` menu](https://github.com/steven-wolfman/ubc-term-finder/settings/access) to invite Piam to collaborate.

Getting set up for editing on your own computer is another huge topic in itself, but the short version to start is to open the repo and click either the "Code" button to get a link to clone the repository or the "Fork" button to fork the repository into your own account (which is the way to go for people outside the main development team who want to contribute or for teams following the [forking workflow](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) or are simply a fan of [the Good Place](https://thegoodplace.fandom.com/wiki/Censored_Curse_Words).

### Norms

To contribute to the package, we'll use a [branch-and-pull-request workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) within the development team. That will start after I put this document into the repo and update the `README.md` file to reflect the requested workflow.
